## Any assumptions or trade-offs I made

- Built two simple apis: `/products` and `/discount`
- Buy-one-get-one-free property is manually set in product

## What I'd do next with more time

- Implement custom logic for promotion. e.g. `buy-three-get-one-free`

## AI tools I used

- Used chatGPT for creating Product card component and NavbarHeader component etc.
- It did a good job for creating component based on good-looking design
